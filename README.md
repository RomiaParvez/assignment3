Problem Statement

This program defines a function to compute the factorial of a given number using recursion. The function returns the computed factorial and is demonstrated with a sample input.

# Implementation Details

The factorial function takes an integer n as input.

It checks if n is negative and returns an appropriate message since factorial is not defined for negative numbers.

If n is 0 or 1, it returns 1 (base case).

Otherwise, it recursively calculates n! as n * factorial(n - 1).

The function is tested with n = 5.

# task2
Problem statement
This program takes a user-inputted number and uses Pythonâ€™s math module to calculate:

The square root of the number.

The natural logarithm (log base e) of the number.

The sine of the number (in radians).

# Implementation Details

The program prompts the user to enter a number.

The math.sqrt() function calculates the square root.

The math.log() function computes the natural logarithm (only for positive numbers).

The math.sin() function calculates the sine of the input (assumed in radians).

The results are displayed to the user
